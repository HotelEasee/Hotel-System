# HotelEase — Admin Dashboard (Vite + React)

This is a frontend admin dashboard built with **Vite + React + TailwindCSS**. It's a lightweight demo that does NOT include API integration or charts (per request) — only navigation, pages, and static/dummy content.

## What is dummy data?
Dummy data means fake sample data used to populate the UI so you can see how it looks and interacts. For example, sample guest entries, employee rows, or room lists that are hard-coded for demo purposes.

## Quick start
1. Extract the zip and `cd` into the folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the admin dashboard.

## Notes
- Tailwind v3 is configured and PostCSS setup included.
- No backend or charts are included in this build.
